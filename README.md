Read Shoes
==========

This is a record of my reading the shoes source code. I was trying to understand how a cross-platform UI library could be written as well as do some bit of code reading.

This is the outcome.

Shoes Abstractions.txt has my findings.
The local version of the repo has (obviously) the shoes source as well. Not replicating it online for obvious reasons.
